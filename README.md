## `Information`
Works like [Nature's Compass](https://github.com/MattCzyr/NaturesCompass) but not! Just right click and select the biome you want to search for! The compass will tell you the coordinates of the nearest instance of that biome. Additionally, if you're in creative mode, you can teleport to it by sneaking and right-clicking!

A continuation of Maya's [Biome Compass](https://github.com/MayaqqDev/biome-compass) with fixes and such.

### `Recipe`
The recipe can use any type of log or sapling!
